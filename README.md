# Third_i
It is an innovative project designed to provide assistance to visually impaired people. It utilizes facial recognition to help people identify their friends and relatives, as well as object detection with distance estimation to detect harmful objects that may be approaching them. If a person carrying the object is unknown to the visually impaired, they will be issued a warning. This project provides an extra layer of safety and security for those with visual impairments, and also provides them with the means to identify familiar faces. It is a revolutionary way to help the visual impairments to navigate their environment safely and independently.
